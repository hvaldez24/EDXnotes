III. PYTHON
A. What is Python?
    1. Powerful and quick language
    2. Has built in feature
B. First Program
SYNTAX:
print("Hello, World!")
prints a line of text inside the parentheses

C. VARIABLES
You do not have to specify the types of variables beign defined in PYTHON
Example:
    a = 25   - integer  int
    b = 1.5     - float float
    c = "Hello!"    - string str
    d = True        - boolean bool
    e = None        - NoneType None
D. Input function
    The function allows the user to type in an Input
    SYNTAX:
    input("Name: ")
    Example 1:
    name = input("Name: ") #Requires user input, and saved in the varialbe "name"
    print("Hello, " + name) #Prints the concantenated output of Hello and name

    Example 2: 
    print(f"Hello, {name}") #Prints the concantenated output of Hello and name
                    |__ Plugging the value of the variable

E.  Conditional Statements
    Example:
    n = input("Number: ")
    #Indetations is required in python to differentiate a statement from other parts of an if statement
    if n > 0:
        print("n is positive")
    elif n < 0
    print("n is negative")
    else:
    print("n is zero")

    If the code is run this message will appear:
    Number: 1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "conditions.py", line 3, in <module>
        if n > 0:
    TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'

    To resolved the error:
    By passing the value if input("Name: ") to an int, the value is converted
    to an integer:
    Example:
    n = int(input("Number: ")) 
    #converts the number typed in by user into a int

F.  Sequences
    
    1. SYNTAX:
    variable = "value"

    print(variable][0])
    |               |__ will obtain the the 1st element of a string which is 0
    |__ Will print the value of the 1st element of the variable  

    Example: 
    
    name = "Harry"

    print(name[1])

    Print:
    H
    2. Data Structures

        a. List
        A sequence of mutable values
        SYNTAX
        
        variable = ["x", "y", "z"]

        function(variable[0])
                        |__ will obtain and index of the list
        *Lists use square brackets
        Example:

        names = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"]

        print(names[0])

            i. Adding a new entry to the list
            SYNTAX:
            variable.append
                        |___ Adds a new entry to the list
            ii. Sorting the entries on a list
            SYNTAX:
            variable.sort()
                        |__ sorts the entries on a list into
                        alphabetical order.

        b. Tuple
        A sequence of immutable values, or values that cannot be changed.
        Grouping values together in one variable
        tupple use a parentheses
        SYNTAX:
        
        variable = (x, y)

        Example: 
        coordinateX = 10.0
        coordinateY = 20.0

        coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)

        c. set
        A collection of unique values
        data is not kept in a particular order

        d. dict
        a data structure that is a collection of key-value pairs
